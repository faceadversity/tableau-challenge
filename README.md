Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the [New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike). program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

## Full Citi Bike Analysis, (04-09)-2023

Citibike, a prominent bike-sharing system, has been a staple of urban transportation. This analysis delves into the ridership trends, challenges faced, and innovations introduced during the period from April to September 2023.

### Ridership Trends
Seasonal Surge: Citibike experienced a noticeable surge in ridership during the warmer months, as people sought outdoor activities and an alternative to crowded public transportation. This is clearly observed in July/August.

### Key Metrics
Total Trips: A comprehensive analysis of the total number of trips taken during the specified period.

### Membership Growth 
Examination of new memberships and changes in user demographics.

### Popular Routes 
Identification of frequently used routes and popular starting and ending stations.

### Technological Enhancements
Mobile App Integration: Unfortunately doesn't fit the current scope of this project.

### Other Miscelleanous Enhancements
Annual Subscription Model: This case study is trying to push a focus on an annual subscription model more towards casual users of the program. 

The analysis of Citibike ridership from April to September 2023 highlights the system's adaptability, resilience, and commitment to providing a sustainable and efficient mode of urban transportation. As cities evolve, Citibike remains a vital player in shaping the future of accessible and eco-friendly commuting.
